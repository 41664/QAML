#A gentle Introduction to Quantum Computing 

The article is intended for people with absolutely no background in computer science or for people interested in understanding what exactly a quantum computer is. 

Before we define what exactly a quantum computer is, let's understand a few concepts in physics namely- superposition, interference and entanglement. 

Now, all matter is made of atoms which comprise of electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons carry a negative charge, protons carry a positive charge and neutrons carry no charge at all. The inside of atom as hypothesized by physicists is something like the solar system, there's a kernel comprising of neutrons and protons and several electrons that revolve around the kernel in orbits with a certain orbital velocity. The laws of physics say that there is no way to calculate the certain position and velocity of an electron deterministically.
